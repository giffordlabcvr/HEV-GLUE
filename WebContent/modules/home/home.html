<h2>HEV-GLUE</h2>

<p>
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) was first documented in 1955, its taxonomic name is <em>Orthohepevirus A</em>. 
It is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus of the Orthohepevirus genus, in the family Hepeviridae. 
Certain strains of HEV are associated with a high mortality rate during pregnancy. HEV can also cause 
chronic hepatitis in certain immunocompromised patients. 
</p>
<p>
HEV infections can be acquired zoonotically via the consumption of undercooked food and also via transfusion of blood products. 
There are currently many deficiencies in our understanding of HEV epidemiology, including the distribution and diversity of 
circulating variants, and the dynamics of transmission within and between host species. 
</p>
<p>
HEV-GLUE is a data-centric bioinformatics resource which organises HEV genome sequence data along evolutionary lines. 
HEV-GLUE aims to leverage new and existing HEV sequences in order to improve our understanding of the epidemiology and pathology of HEV.
The resource can be used either via a web site or via an offline version 
aimed at more experienced bioinformaticians. The web site includes:
<ul>
<li>A curated database of NCBI HEV <a href="#/project/sequence" target="_blank">sequences</a>, with metadata.</li>
<li>A curated database of HEV <a href="#/project/alignment" target="_blank">clades</a> (genotypes, subtypes) and reference sequences.</li>
<li>Curated multiple-sequence alignments for all the NCBI sequences assigned to each clade.</li>
<li>An <a href="#analysisTool" target="_blank">analysis tool</a> supporting genotyping and interpretation of submitted consensus (FASTA) sequences.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The various datasets are integrated together in <a href="http://tools.glue.cvr.ac.uk">GLUE</a>, 
a data-centric software framework for capturing, developing and utilising nucleotide-level virus evolutionary 
hypotheses. For more information about GLUE and HEV-GLUE, please contact
